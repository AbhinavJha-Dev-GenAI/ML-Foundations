# Unsupervised Learning

Algorithms that discover hidden structures or patterns in data without explicit labels.

## 🎯 Key Topics

### 1. Clustering
Grouping similar data points together.
- **K-Means**: Partitioning data into $K$ clusters by minimizing the distance to the cluster centroid.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering that can find clusters of arbitrary shapes and identify noise (outliers).
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Building a tree of clusters (Dendrogram).

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction
Simplifying data while keeping the most important information.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Finding new orthogonal features that capture the maximum variance.
- **t-SNE**: A non-linear technique used mainly for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.

### 3. Association Rule Learning
Finding relationships between variables in large databases.
- **Example**: "People who bought bread also bought butter." Used in market basket analysis.

## 📚 Why it Matters
Unsupervised learning is essential when labels are expensive or impossible to get. It is used for customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and as a pre-processing step to make complex data more manageable.
