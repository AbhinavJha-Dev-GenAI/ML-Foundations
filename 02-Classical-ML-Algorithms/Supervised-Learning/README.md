# Supervised Learning

Models that learn a mapping from input features to a target variable using historical data.

## 🎯 Key Topics

### 1. Regression
Predicting a continuous numerical value.
- **Linear Regression**: Finding the best-fit line by minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Polynomial Regression**: Modeling non-linear relationships by adding higher-degree features.
- **Regularization (Lasso/Ridge)**: Adding a penalty term to prevents the model from growing too complex (overfitting).

### 2. Classification
Predicting a discrete label or category.
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicting probabilities using the Sigmoid function. Used for binary classification.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machines)**: Finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Classifying a point based on the labels of its closest neighbors.
- **Decision Trees**: Splitting data into branches based on feature values to maximize Information Gain or Gini Impurity.

## 📚 Why it Matters
Supervised learning is the most common form of ML used in industry today, powering everything from credit scoring to medical imaging. Most real-world problems can be framed as either a regression or a classification task.
