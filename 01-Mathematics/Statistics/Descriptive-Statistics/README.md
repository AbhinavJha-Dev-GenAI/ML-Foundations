# Descriptive Statistics

Methods for summarizing and organizing data.

## 🎯 Key Topics

### 1. Measures of Central Tendency
- **Mean**: The arithmetic average. Sensitive to outliers.
- **Median**: The middle value when data is sorted. Robust to outliers.
- **Mode**: The most frequent value.

### 2. Measures of Dispersion (Spread)
- **Range**: Difference between Max and Min.
- **Variance**: Average squared distance from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance. Most common measure of spread.
- **Percentiles/Quartiles**: Values that divide data into 100 or 4 equal parts.

### 3. Distribution Shape
- **Skewness**: Measures asymmetry (Positive/Right-skewed vs Negative/Left-skewed).
- **Kurtosis**: Measures the "tailedness" of the distribution (Sharp peak vs Flat).

## 📚 Why it Matters
Before building any model, we must perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. Descriptive statistics give us the "first look" at our data, helping us spot errors, outliers, and potential biases.
