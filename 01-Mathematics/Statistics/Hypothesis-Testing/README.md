# Hypothesis Testing

Making statistical inferences about populations based on samples.

## 🎯 Key Topics

### 1. The Setup
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The status quo (e.g., "The new model is the same as the old one").
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**: What we want to prove (e.g., "The new model is better").

### 2. P-Values and Significance
- **P-Value**: The probability of seeing our results (or more extreme) if $H_0$ were true.
- **$\alpha$ (Significance Level)**: The threshold for rejecting $H_0$ (usually 0.05). If p-value $< \alpha$, we reject $H_0$.

### 3. Standard Tests
- **Z-Test**: Used when population variance is known and sample size is large.
- **T-Test**: Used when population variance is unknown (common in small samples).
- **ANOVA**: Used to compare means across three or more groups.

### 4. Errors
- **Type I (False Positive)**: Rejecting $H_0$ when it was actually true.
- **Type II (False Negative)**: Failing to reject $H_0$ when it was actually false.

## 📚 Why it Matters
Hypothesis testing is the scientific method for data. It prevents us from being fooled by random noise and ensures that the "patterns" we find in our data are statistically significant.
