# Confidence Intervals

Estimating the range within which a population parameter is likely to fall.

## 🎯 Key Topics

### 1. Core Definition
A Confidence Interval (CI) gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated range being calculated from a given set of sample data.
- **Example**: "We are 95% confident that the mean height is between 170cm and 175cm."

### 2. The Relationship with Sample Size
- **Larger sample size** $\rightarrow$ Smaller Standard Error $\rightarrow$ **Narrower CI** (More precise).
- **Higher confidence level** (e.g., 99% vs 95%) $\rightarrow$ **Wider CI**.

### 3. Margin of Error
The amount of error that the researcher is willing to tolerate. It depends on the confidence level and the variability in the data.

## 📚 Why it Matters
In ML, we don't just want a "point estimate" (a single number). We want to know how certain we are. Confidence intervals help us communicate the reliability of our model's predictions to stakeholders.
