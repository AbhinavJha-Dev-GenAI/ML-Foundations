# Advanced Projects

Complex, end-to-end Machine Learning implementations.

## 🎯 Project Roadmap

### 1. Image Classification with CNNs
- **Goal**: Build a model to recognize objects/people in images.
- **Concepts**: Convolutional layers, Data augmentation, Transfer learning (Pre-trained models like ResNet).

### 2. Sentiment Analysis with Transformers
- **Goal**: Classify the sentiment of movie reviews or tweets.
- **Concepts**: NLP pre-processing, Tokenization, Fine-tuning BERT/RoBERTa models.

### 3. Recommendation Engine
- **Goal**: Build a "Collaborative Filtering" system like Netflix.
- **Concepts**: Matrix Factorization, SVD, Content-based vs Collaborative based systems.

## 📚 Skills Gained
Advanced projects move beyond tabular data into Deep Learning (using PyTorch or TensorFlow) and complex architectures used in state-of-the-art AI systems.
