- **Concepts**: SMOTE (Oversampling), Precision-Recall curves, XGBoost.

### 2. Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- **Goal**: Group customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Concepts**: K-Means clustering, Elbow method for choosing $K$, PCA for visualization.

### 3. Time-Series Forecasting
- **Goal**: Predict future stock prices or energy consumption.
- **Concepts**: Rolling statistics, Stationarity (ADF test), ARIMA models.
