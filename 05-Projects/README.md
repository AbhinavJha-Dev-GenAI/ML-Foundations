# 05. ML-Foundations Projects 🛠️🚀

Foundational projects to build a strong base in classical machine learning.

## Project 1: Titanic Survival Predictor 🚢
*   **Goal**: Predict which passengers survived the shipwreck using features like age, gender, and class.
*   **Tech Stack**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas.
*   **Key Learning**: Basic Classification, Handling missing values, and Encoding categorical data.

## Project 2: House Price Regression 🏠
*   **Goal**: Predict the final price of each home based on features like area, year built, and location.
*   **Tech Stack**: XGBoost, Scikit-Learn.
*   **Key Learning**: Regression metrics (MSE/MAE), Feature scaling, and Hyperparameter tuning.

## Project 3: Customer Segmentation (Clustering) 👥
*   **Goal**: Group mall customers into segments based on their annual income and spending score.
*   **Tech Stack**: K-Means Clustering, Matplotlib.
*   **Key Learning**: Unsupervised learning, Elbow method for finding $k$, and Visualizing clusters.

## Project 4: SMS Spam Detector (Naive Bayes) 📧
*   **Goal**: Classify text messages as spam or ham using a probabilistic approach.
*   **Tech Stack**: Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Scikit-Learn.
*   **Key Learning**: Text preprocessing (Stopwords, Stemming) and Naive Bayes probability.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  **Platform**: Use **Kaggle** to find these classic datasets and compete with others.
2.  **Visualization**: Use **Seaborn** to create Heatmaps (Correlation) and Pairplots to understand the relationships in your data before building models.
3.  **Pipeline**: Learn to use `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` to bundle your preprocessing and modeling steps together for cleaner, production-ready code.
