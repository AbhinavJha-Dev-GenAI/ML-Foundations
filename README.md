## ðŸ“š What You'll Learn
The mathematical and statistical backbone of ML/AI. This is for the engineer who wants to understand the "why" behind the code.

### Core Topics
- âœ… **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, Matrices, SVD, Eigenvalues
- âœ… **Probability**: Distributions, Bayes Theorem, Entropy, KL Divergence
- âœ… **Statistics**: Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing, Confidence Intervals
- âœ… **Optimization**: Gradient Descent, Convex Optimization, Loss Surfaces
- âœ… **Classical ML**: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi-supervised learning
